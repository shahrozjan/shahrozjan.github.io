# Project Portfolio

## Deck Detective

**Description:**
Engineered a peer-to-peer, turn-based multiplayer web application using React, leveraging PeerJS and WebRTC for seamless real-time communication. Implemented a lightweight signaling server on Render to facilitate initial peer discovery and connection, enabling a decentralized and scalable architecture. Hosted the static app on GitHub Pages, with all game logic executed locally on each peer, ensuring smooth game progression based on individual turns.

## TonDone Cross Platform Mobile App

**Description:**
As part of the TonDone project, I was responsible for developing a range of REST APIs with a MariaDB backend. These APIs were designed to handle a large user base, efficiently serving thousands of users across the mobile app. I played a key role in creating new features for the app, such as the 'Create New Work Order Page' and 'Quick Actions Page'. Both features were developed using XAML for the front end, while the backend was powered by the REST APIs I had built. This project also involved refactoring parts of the app for better performance and maintainability in Xamarin and MAUI.

## B+ Tree Implementation

**Description:**
For this project, I designed and implemented a B+ Tree data structure as part of a larger database management system (DBMS) assignment. The B+ Tree was optimized to ensure efficient data insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, balancing the branching factor to maintain tree height and performance. I carefully tuned the B+ Tree to work effectively under different data loads and ensured that it performed optimally at various fanouts, improving query performance in the database. The implementation was completed using C++ and leveraged advanced object-oriented design principles.

## SignalR-GRPC Message Reader

**Description:**
In this project, I developed both the front end and backend for a highly scalable .NET Core message reader and sender system. The system was designed to handle multiple devices concurrently by utilizing SignalR for a persistent connection, enabling real-time messaging between devices. I integrated the system with GRPC for high-performance communication, allowing it to read and send messages across several devices in real-time. This project was crucial for scaling device communication and provided a reliable platform for handling large volumes of data from IoT devices.

## Mass Device Simulator

**Description:**
I developed a Mass Device Simulator capable of running a large number of virtual devices, each sending and receiving messages to and from the cloud using IoTHub. This project was built using the .NET Framework and utilized a modular approach to manage the complex interactions between devices. The simulator was deployed in a Docker environment, enabling it to handle thousands of simultaneous device connections. It significantly improved the testing process for IoT devices by simulating real-world scenarios in a controlled cloud environment, making it easier to detect and fix issues before deployment.

## Mass Device Registration and Data Generation

**Description:**
I single-handedly delivered the project built on .NET Core which required knowledge of Parallel Programming as well as asynchronous programming along with SQL. I also developed an application that generates a large amount of device data in seconds. The data generated could readily be customized as per the specifications of the device.
