# ABOUT ME

I'm Shahroz Jan, a Software Engineer with over 3 years of
experience in software engineering, ranging from backend API
development to cloud automation and mobile app projects. I
graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from
Rutgers University-New Brunswick with a 3.88 GPA in May 2024.
I thrive on creating solutions that serve thousands of users,
and on learning new technologies with every project. On the
personal side, my hobbies include hiking, going to rock
 concerts, and playing video games. I was also (almost) a
semi-professional gamer and won a CSGO College National
championship. By the way, I built this site using ReactJS in
monospace theme.
